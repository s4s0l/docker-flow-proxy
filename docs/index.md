The goal of the *Docker Flow Proxy* project is to provide an easy way to reconfigure proxy every time a new service is deployed, or when a service is scaled. It does not try to "reinvent the wheel", but to leverage the existing leaders and combine them through an easy to use integration. It uses [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) as a proxy and adds custom logic that allows on-demand reconfiguration.

*Docker Flow Proxy* examples can be found in the *Tutorials* section located in the left-hand menu.

Please visit the [Configuring Docker Flow Proxy](config.md) and [Usage](usage.md) sections for more details.

[Feedback and contributions](feedback-and-contribution.md) are appreciated.
