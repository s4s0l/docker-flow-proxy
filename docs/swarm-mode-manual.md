# Running Docker Flow Proxy In Swarm Mode With Manual Reconfiguration

*Docker Flow Proxy* running in the *swarm* mode is designed to leverage the features introduced in Docker v1.12.

## Examples

The examples that follow assume that you have Docker Machine version v0.8+ that includes Docker Engine v1.12+. The easiest way to get them is through [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

!!! info
	If you are a Windows user, please run all the examples from *Git Bash* (installed through *Docker Toolbox*).

Please note that *Docker Flow Proxy* is not limited to *Docker Machine*. We're using it as an easy way to create a cluster.

### Setup

To setup an example environment using Docker Machine, please run the commands that follow.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vfarcic/docker-flow-proxy.git

cd docker-flow-proxy

chmod +x scripts/swarm-cluster.sh

scripts/swarm-cluster.sh
```

Right now we have three machines running (*node-1*, *node-2*, and *node-3*). Each of those machines runs Docker Engine. Together, they form a Swarm cluster. Docker Engine running in the first node (*node-1*) is the leader.

We can see the cluster status by running the following command.

```bash
eval $(docker-machine env node-1)

docker node ls
```

We'll skip a detailed explanation of the Swarm cluster that is incorporated into Docker Engine 1.12. If you're new to it, please read [Docker Swarm Introduction](https://technologyconversations.com/2016/07/29/docker-swarm-introduction-tour-around-docker-1-12-series/). The rest of this article will assume that you have, at least, basic Docker 1.12+ knowledge.

Now we're ready to deploy a service.

### Reconfiguring the Proxy

We'll start by creating two networks.

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay proxy

docker network create --driver overlay go-demo
```

The first (*proxy*) will be dedicated to the proxy container and services that should be exposed through it. The second (*go-demo*) is the network used for communications between containers that constitute the *go-demo* service.

Let's deploy the demo service. It consists of two containers; *mongo* is the database and *vfarcic/go-demo* is the actual service that uses it. They will communicate with each other through the *go-demo* network. Since we want to expose only *vfarcic/go-demo* to the "outside" world and keep the database "private", only the *vfarcic/go-demo* container will attach itself to the *proxy* network.

```bash
docker service create --name go-demo-db \
  --network go-demo \
  mongo
```

We can see the status of the service by executing the `service ls` command. Please wait until it has replicas set to *1/1*.

```bash
docker service ls
```

Let's run up the second service.

```bash
docker service create --name go-demo \
  -e DB=go-demo-db \
  --network go-demo \
  --network proxy \
  vfarcic/go-demo
```

Please wait until it has replicas set to *1/1*.

The details of the *go-demo* service are irrelevant for this exercise. What matters is that it was deployed somewhere inside the cluster and that it does not have any port exposed outside of the networks *go-demo* and *proxy*.

The only thing missing now is to reconfigure the proxy so that our newly deployed service is accessible on a standard HTTP port *80*. That is the problem *Docker Flow Proxy* is solving.

```bash
docker service create --name proxy \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    --network proxy \
    -e MODE=swarm \
    vfarcic/docker-flow-proxy
```

We opened ports *80* and *443*. External requests will be routed through them towards the destination services. The third port (*8080*) will be used to send requests to the proxy specifying what it should do. The proxy it belongs to the *proxy* network and has the mode set to *swarm*.

As before, please use the `docker service ls` command to check that the container is running (replicas set to 1/1) before proceeding with the rest of the article.

Now that the proxy is running, we can tell it to include the *go-demo* service in its configuration.

```bash
curl "$(docker-machine ip node-1):8080/v1/docker-flow-proxy/reconfigure?serviceName=go-demo&servicePath=/demo&port=8080"
```

That's it. All we had to do is send an HTTP request to `reconfigure` the proxy. The `serviceName` query contains the name of the service we want to integrate with the proxy. The `servicePath` is the unique URL that identifies the service. Finally, the `port` should match the internal port of the service. Please note that it does not matter which server we hit with the request. The routing mesh will make sure that it is redirected to the destination container.

The output of the reconfigure request is as follows (formatted for better readability).

```json
{
  "Status": "OK",
  "Message": "",
  "ServiceName": "go-demo",
  "ServiceColor": "",
  "ServicePath": [
    "/demo"
  ],
  "ServiceDomain": "",
  "PathType": "",
  "SkipCheck": false,
  "Mode": "swarm",
  "Port": "8080"
}
```

*Docker Flow Proxy* responded saying that reconfiguration of the service *go-demo* running on the path */demo* was performed successfully.

Let's see whether the service is indeed accessible through the proxy.

```bash
curl -i $(docker-machine ip node-1)/demo/hello
```

The output of the `curl` command is as follows.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 07 Jul 2016 23:14:47 GMT
Content-Length: 14
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

hello, world!
```

The response is *200 OK*, meaning that our service is indeed accessible through the proxy. All we had to do is tell *docker-flow-proxy* the name of the service.

Since *Docker Flow Proxy* uses new networking features added to Docker 1.12, it redirects all requests to the internally created SDN. As a result, Docker takes care of load balancing, so there is no need to reconfigure the proxy every time a new instance is deployed. We can confirm that by creating a few additional replicas.

```bash
docker service update --replicas 5 go-demo

curl -i $(docker-machine ip node-1)/demo/hello
```

Feel free to repeat this request a few more times. Once done, check the logs of any of the replicas and you'll notice that it received approximately one-fifth of the requests. No matter how many instances are running and with which frequency they change, swarm network will make sure that requests are load balanced across all currently running instances.

*Docker Flow Proxy* reconfiguration is not limited to a single *service path*. Multiple values can be divided by comma (*,*). For example, our service might expose multiple versions of the API. In such a case, an example reconfiguration request could be as follows.

```bash
curl "$(docker-machine ip node-1):8080/v1/docker-flow-proxy/reconfigure?serviceName=go-demo&servicePath=/demo/hello,/demo/person&port=8080"
```

The result from the `curl` request is the reconfiguration of the *HAProxy* so that the *go-demo* service can be accessed through both the */demo/hello* and the */demo/person* paths.

Optionally, *serviceDomain* can be used as well. If specified, the proxy will allow access only to requests coming from that domain. The example that follows sets *serviceDomain* to *my-domain.com*. After the proxy is reconfigured, only requests for that domain will be redirected to the destination service.

```bash
curl "$(docker-machine ip node-1):8080/v1/docker-flow-proxy/reconfigure?serviceName=go-demo&servicePath=/demo&serviceDomain=my-domain.com&port=8080"
```

For a more detailed example, please read the [Integrating Proxy With Docker Swarm](https://technologyconversations.com/2016/08/01/integrating-proxy-with-docker-swarm-tour-around-docker-1-12-series/) article.

### Removing a Service From the Proxy

We can as easily remove a service from the *Docker Flow Proxy*. An example that removes the service *go-demo* is as follows.

```bash
curl "$(docker-machine ip node-1):8080/v1/docker-flow-proxy/remove?serviceName=go-demo"
```

From this moment on, the service *go-demo* is not available through the proxy.
